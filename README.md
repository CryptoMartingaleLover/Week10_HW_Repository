### Week 10 Time Series Homework
#####  by Steve Stark


#### **This homework submission consists of two .ipynb documents:** 
- hw_regression_analysis.ipynb
- hw_time_series_analysis.ipynb

#### **hw_regression_analysis.ipynb**

##### In this notebook, I built a Scikit-Learn linear regression model to predict Yen futures ("settle") returns with *lagged* Yen futures returns.

##### In conclusion, the out-of-sample RSME was lower than the in-sample RSME, suggesting that the model was a bit underfit for the data. Actual data significantly outperformed the predictions. 

#### **hw_time_series_analysis.ipynb**

##### In this notebook, I loaded historical Dollar-Yen exchange rate futures data and applied time series analysis and modeling to determine whether there was any predictable behavior.

##### In conclusion, the yen was forecast to continue creeping up in price on a daily basis, while the daily returns were expected to remain a bit flat. It was my determination that I would wait to see the projected daily returns creep up before I would buy.
